# 🧠 ChatGPT Memory Diagnostic + Upgrade Prompt

A precision tool for auditing, upgrading, and configuring ChatGPT’s memory behavior using a single structured prompt.  
Built for power users, high-context collaborators, and those designing long-term GPT workflows.

---

## 🩺 What This Prompt Does

This prompt transforms ChatGPT into a system architect that:

1. **Audits what the AI has remembered about you**
2. **Generates a detailed diagnostic across six key memory categories**
3. **Builds a fully modular Memory Upgrade Block**
4. **Asks if you'd like to install the new memory structure**
5. **Offers optional tools for memory self-management**

---

## 🛠️ Use Case

Ideal for users who:
- Collaborate with GPT across multiple projects  
- Want persistent memory to reflect tone, format, and preferences  
- Prefer structured interaction over AI guesswork  
- Test or debug long-term memory behaviors

---

## 🚀 How To Use

1. Copy everything inside `memory_audit_prompt.txt`
2. Paste into any ChatGPT Pro chat (GPT-4 with memory enabled)
3. Send as a **single prompt**  
4. Let it run the full 3-step diagnostic  
5. Optionally say “Yes” to install the Memory Upgrade Block  
6. Save the results (recommended)

You can rerun this prompt monthly or after major project shifts.
